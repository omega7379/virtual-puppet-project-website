## What is VPupPr

VPupPr is an open-source project that animates 3D objects using the glb or vrm file extension. 
Most notable for using 3D vtube models as its main usage.

## Platform Supported

Currently supported on windows and common linux distributions. MacOS/OSX is not currently supported,
feel free to fork the github [repo](https://github.com/virtual-puppet-project/vpuppr) and offer it to
the community!

## Submitting Issues

[Click here](https://github.com/virtual-puppet-project/vpuppr/issues) to submit issues. Be sure to include
operating system, app version, logs, and any other information related to the bug.

## Building from Source

VPupPr runs off a custom godot engine. Get the pre-compiled engine [here](https://github.com/you-win/godot/releases).
You can find the instructions [here]({{< ref "source/#building-from-source">}})

## Tracking is not Responding

Please note it might take a second for the tracking to activate. It _is_ trying to map your face! Also check that
your face is well lit, usually having a lamp above your desk is enough. If it's still not working, submit an issue
and/or ask the discord community!

## Why is mouse-tracking not included by default

Simply put, it's a very niche thing and not a lot of people will be using it. If enough people ask about it, it might be
considered later.

## What is engine is VPupPr using

Currently VPupPr runs on godot 3.x with plans to port over to 4.x once the beta becomes more stable.
