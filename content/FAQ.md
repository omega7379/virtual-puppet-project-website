## I read the docs but still need help!

## What is VPupPr

VPupPr is an open-source project that animates models using the `glb` and `vrm` file extension. 
it is most notable for tracking and rendering 3D Vtube models.

## Platform supported

Currently supported on Windows and common Linux distributions. OSX is not currently supported, however,
feel free to fork the github [repo](https://github.com/virtual-puppet-project/vpuppr)!

## Submitting issues

[Click here](https://github.com/virtual-puppet-project/vpuppr/issues) to submit issues. Be sure to include
operating system, app version, logs, and any other information related to the bug.

## Building from source

VPupPr runs off a custom build off the Godot engine. Get a pre-compiled build of engine [here](https://github.com/you-win/godot/releases).
You can find the instructions [here]({{< ref "source/#building-from-source">}}).

## Tracking is not responding

Please note it might take a second for the tracking to activate. It _is_ trying to map your face! Also check that
your face is well lit, usually having a lamp above your desk is enough. If it's still not working, submit an issue
and/or ask the Discord community!

## Why is mouse-tracking not included by default

Simply put, it's a very niche thing and not a lot of people will be using it. If enough people ask about it, it might be
considered later.

## What engine is VPupPr using

Currently VPupPr runs on Godot 3.x with plans to port over to 4.x once the beta becomes more stable.
