            <h2>OpenSeeFace vs OpenSeeFace-GD vs VPupPr</h2>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/emilianavt/OpenSeeFace">OpenSeeFace</a> (OSF) is a tracker created and maintained by github user <a href="https://github.com/emilianavt">
                emilianavt</a> whereas <a href="https://github.com/you-win/openseeface-gd">OpenSeeFace-GD</a> (OSF-GD) is a GUI created by <a href="https://github.com/you-win">YouWin</a>
                to interact with the OSF tracker. Finally the newly released <a href="https://github.com/virtual-puppet-project/vpuppr">virtual-puppet-project</a> (VPupPr) is a massive
                rebranding and complete overhaul of OSF-GD and to help eliminate confusion with OSF</p>
            </br>
            <h2>OpenSeeFace or IFacialMocap</h2>
            <p>OSF is the built-in tracker for VPuPr and uses your camera directly connected to your pc. <a href="https://www.ifacialmocap.com/">IFacialMocap (IFM)</a>
                is a separate app for IOS that uses the advanced facial mapping from Apple's camera sensors within the IPhone/IPad. Either tracker works with VPupPr
                so it's really up to preference which one you use.</p>
            </br>
            <h2>I read the documentation and still have no clue</h2>
            <p>Come join the discord! We can't guarantee help right away but there's a wide variety of windows, linux, and mac users in there.</p>
            </br>
            <h2>Will there be an easier way to download VPupPr?</h2>
            <p>Currently github user <a href="https://github.com/orowith2os">Oro</a> is maintaining an official flatpak that regularly gets updated. You
                can find them in the community discord too if you have specific questions regarding the flatpak.</p>
            </br>
            <h2>What is VPupPr?</h2>
            <p>VPupPr is an open-source project that animates 3D objects using the glb or vrm file extension. Most notable for using 3D vtube models as its main usage.</p>
            </br>

            <p>Currently VPupPr version 0.9.0 (alpha) is released for windows and linux distributions with plans to port over to mac OSX. If using linux, make sure to
                install all necessary dependencies using <em>pip</em> within a virtual environment (venv folder). As always, please read documentation fully and join us
